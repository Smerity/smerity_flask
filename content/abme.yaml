title: "About Me"
content: |
    My name is Stephen Merity, though I'm most commonly referred to as Smerity.
    I'm a senior research scientist working on deep learning in San Francisco with [MetaMind](https://www.metamind.io/), acquired by [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/).

    I've been lucky enough to work with fascinating people and groups over the years including Google Sydney, Freelancer.com, the [Schwa Lab](http://schwa.org/) at the University of Sydney, the team at [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com/), the non-profit [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/), and [IACS @ Harvard](http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/).
    You can read my full history in <a href="/media/files/resume.pdf">my resume</a> or at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/smerity">LinkedIn</a>.
    Feel free to contact me in person at <a href="mailto:smerity@smerity.com">smerity@smerity.com</a> or stalk me on my various social networks!

    ## NCSS
    A true _about me_ would have to mention the [National Computer Science School](http://www.ncss.edu.au) (NCSS), a summer school run at the University of Sydney involving talented high school students from all over Australia.
    Having had the privilege of going there eight times (first in 2007 as a student, then in 2008 as a returning student and finally as a tutor in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), it has been one of the most delightful experiences of my entire life.

    Over the course of a little over a week, students are introduced to a programming language, taken step by step through a set of educational challenges, and then work together to launch a fully fledged working product.
    This product has been a search engine, a social network, a group of maze navigating robots and every variation inbetween!

    If you're a student or know someone that general age, sign up to [NCSS](http://www.ncss.edu.au) or into [NCSS Challenge](http://challenge.ncss.edu.au)!
