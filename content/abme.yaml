title: "About Me"
content: |
    My name is Stephen Merity, though I'm most commonly referred to as Smerity.
    I'm a data scientist in San Francisco with [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/), where we save billions of web pages every month for anyone to use, completely free.

    I've been lucky enough to work with fascinating people and groups over the years including Google Sydney, Freelancer.com, the Schwa Lab at the University of Sydney, the team at Grok Learning, and IACS @ Harvard.
    You can read my full history in <a href="/media/files/resume.pdf">my resume</a> or at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/smerity">LinkedIn</a>.
    Finally, contact me in person at <a href="mailto:smerity@smerity.com">smerity@smerity.com</a> or stalk me on my various social networks!

    ## NCSS
    A true _about me_ would have to mention the [National Computer Science School](http://www.ncss.edu.au) (NCSS), a summer school run at the University of Sydney involving talented high school students from all over Australia.
    Having had the privilege of going there eight times (first in 2007 as a student, then in 2008 as a returning student and finally as a tutor in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), it has been one of the most delightful experiences of my entire life.

    Over the course of a little over a week, students are introduced to a programming language, taken step by step through a set of educational challenges, and then work together to launch a fully fledged working product.
    This product has been a search engine, a social network, a group of maze navigating robots and every variation inbetween!

    If you're a student or know someone that general age, sign up to [NCSS](http://www.ncss.edu.au) or into [NCSS Challenge](http://challenge.ncss.edu.au)!
