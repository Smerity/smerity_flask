title: "About Me"
content: |
    My name is Stephen Merity, though I'm more commonly referred to as Smerity.
    For more details you can view my <a href="/media/files/resume.pdf">resume</a> or contact me in person at <a href="mailto:smerity@smerity.com">smerity@smerity.com</a>.

    Searching for _Smerity_ will find most places I've inhabited online.
    If you're interested, almost all my Facebook communications are public as it allows people to discover a small amount of who I am, and reminds me that even private things on Facebook aren't private.

    ## University & Work
    I've recently completed the [Bachelor of Information Technology](http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Information-Technology) at the University of Sydney, receiving First Class Honours and [University Medal](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_Medal&oldid=410146835#Australia).
    I've recently started working full time at [Freelancer.com](http://www.freelancer.com), where I originally began as an intern working on data mining and interaction mechanics.
    In the past, I've worked at [Google](http://www.google.com) as an intern on Google AppEngine.

    ## Programming
    In specific areas of programming, I have a soft spot for Natural Language Processing - a special thanks to [Dr James R. Curran](http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~james) for introducing it to me.
    I've also spent a deal of time play with a wide range of programming subtopics, including such things as computer graphics, machine learning and optimization techniques such as linear programming.

    ## NCSS
    A true "about me" would have to mention NCSS.
    NCSS is the [National Computer Science School](http://www.ncss.edu.au), a summer school run at the University of Sydney involving talented high school students from all over Australia. Having had the privilege of going there five times (first in 2007 as a student, then in 2008 as a returning student and finally as a tutor in 2009, 2010 and 2011) I can honestly say it was one of the most delightful experiences of my entire life.
    If you're a student or know someone that general age, sign up to [NCSS](http://www.ncss.edu.au) or into [NCSS Challenge](http://challenge.ncss.edu.au)!
