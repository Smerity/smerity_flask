    ## Human language used to be inert unless a human interacted with it

    Decades ago a book remained static until read.

    A few years ago images, video, and audio were static too.

    This may seem obvious but keep iteratively expanding the consequences until you've found a comfy spot between awe and terror.

    Human language used to require humans be involved.
    That's no longer true.
    The possibilities are endless.
    And yet we're still dealing with the simplest of consequences as the results chaotically unfurl across society.

    ## Old school

    This is as true of the earliest of natural language processing as it is of modern machine learning.

    The late 90s saw search engines arrive.
    They hunt down new text and break natural langauge apart in real time, indexing it for all the world to find.

    Whilst it unlocked massive potential compared to the days of yore we may have been bamboozled.
    What we have is a giant machine cracking apart language as if it were Lego blocks, entirely oblivious to the knowledge under the covers.
    We have library shelves that refill themselves depending on whether you walked into the library from a coffee shop or a conference.
    We have books inserted that are larger if an author is well known (for a specific definition of well known) or if the text in the book fits a certain layout.
    Even when our finger flicks across the top of a book's spine idly the librarian is taking notes in our file.

    This might sound magical for some - maybe? - but regardless of the awe or terror it invokes it's also entirely out of our control.
    We still haven't reconciled even the simplest of automated functions - creating a real time index - and yet technology moves forward.

    So far we've only spoken about human language.
    Human language is usually a poor reflection of or entirely fictional vaiation of an underlying natural language.
    Many of these natural languages humans can't read or write.
    There are even more natural languages that we don't even know exist.

    Yet natural language covers far more than written or spoken text.
    Language is in the pixels of an image, the scientific readings of a complex instrument, and the unfurling of cells into a branch.
    It might not be a language we're capable of reading yet - just as a book was once inert without a human - but it may soon be a language that we can at least steal glimpses of.

    The machine learning revolution is promising to unlock the hidden structure in many of these languages.

    I've written a language model that can unlock structure in English and XML that I wouldn't be able to capture or describe.
    In generating samples of text I would need to look up hockey positions to check if my language model was hallucinating or reciting reality.

    Thanks to others that same language model has been retrained to operate in written languages that I wouldn't even identify the alphabet for.
    The same tool being used across languages, across fields, with the author having no clue what is even possible.

    What we're constructing are generic natural language processors.
    We don't know what they're capable of or what uses, good or bad, we may have for them.
