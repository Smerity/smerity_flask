    On the weekend I caught up with Chris Lloyd, one of the co-founders of [Minefold](https://minefold.com/).
    During our extended cafe / lunch / afternoon chat session, we touched upon a number of things I think it's important to note for posterity.

    + easy_install &rarr; virtualenv + pip
    + pip -> rest
    + flask-bcrypt equals sad face -- no easy way to compile C with correct Python libraries on the shared server
    + Apache &rarr; app.fcgi
    + Apache rewrite rules to push all URLs to app.fci/...
