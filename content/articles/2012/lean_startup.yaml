    At the Amazon Lean Cloud conference at the Australian Technology Park, Eric Ries presented on [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) methodology.
    On top of the interesting discussions generated by the Mr Ries, I was also lucky enough to score a free signed book ;)  
    Below are running notes from his presentation.

    ### Core Tenets

    1. Entrepreneurs are everywhere
    2. Entrepreneurship is Management
    3. Validated Learning
    4. Build &rarr; Measure &rarr; Learn
    5. Innovation Accounting

    __Startup = Experiment__  
    Startups: turn ideas into code  
    We're still early in the startup phase of the Internet and we're still working out the optimal way to run these startups  
    _Most startups fail_ but we can't use that to justify making the wrong decisions

    <span class="label label-info">Entrepreneurial Management:</span>&nbsp; management that survives and can handle adversity

    <span class="label label-info">Pivot:</span>&nbsp; change the startup's direction but stay grounded in what has been learned  
    How many opportunities do we have left to pivot &rarr; runway

    <span class="label label-info">Pivot:</span>&nbsp; Driving your car off the cliff whilst positively mentioning the gas mileage

    <span class="label label-info">Learning & Feedback:</span>&nbsp; Don't wait until you fail to learn something important, do it _early_ and _often_

    ## Build &rarr; Measure &rarr; Learn

    + MVP
    + Funnel / cohort analysis
    + Continuous Deployment
    + Some experiments you spend more time arguing about than building and deploying it

    'You can drive faster if you close your eyes and put your foot on the accelerator' is equivalent to 'You can code and execute faster if you don't understand what you're doing'

    For every pieces of advice, you can find a startup that did it and succeeded and a startup that did it and failed.

    We need an accounting revolution  
    Everyone likes to talk about the process stuff from Toyota

    <span class="label label-info">Accountability:</span>&nbsp; If you pitch FFF/VCs/... and get $X to spend in the next Y months, there's no guarantee on the quality of the product but there is a guarantee that by the end of Y months all the money will be spent.

    For startups, the _Brink of Success_ is indistinguishable from the _Brink of Failure_ -- how can a VC tell them apart?

    ## Innovation Accounting

    1. Establish the baseline (MVP + measure how customers behave _right now_)
    2. Tune the engine (experiment to see if we can improve metrics from baseline to ideal)
    3. Pivot or persevere (experiments reach diminishing returns, it's time to pivot)

    You know the % of customers sign up for service number in all those spreadsheets?  
    That's a leap of faith assumption that our entire company depends on  
    Not _sensitivity analysis_, it's _gross failure analysis_

    No-one does this as it's _bad news_  but it's better to have _bad news_ that's true than _good news_ that's __made up__

    For each leap of faith assumption, do the least amount of work possible to find out what that number actually is

    <blockquote><p>
    When improving bad software, making it easier makes it easier for customers to realise they don't want it
    </p></blockquote>

    Pivot at the optimal time, not when the wall / ceiling / sky is falling in  
    Every six weeks, add a meeting to the calendar called __Pivot or Persevere__  
    If six weeks from today I need to sit in that meeting, what numbers do I need to push for either pivot or persevere?
    Is what I'm doing right now going to help with that?

    <p class="alert alert-info">
    Each company should be built to learn from the ground up.
    People in fifty years will laugh at how obvious all of this is.
    </p>

    <!--
    + How do we know when to pivot?
    + Vision or Strategy or Product?

    ## On Entrepreneurial Hubs

    + Silicon Valley is a big advertisement -- "if you have a successful company, bring them over here!"
    + Instead of copying Silicon Valley one for one, work out what advantages Silicon Valley has and work out a way to achieve those same advantages
