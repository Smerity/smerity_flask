    In my recent experiments with Coffescript and Canvas I've come across a Mandelbug in Google Chrome.
    This post won't go into too much detail about the Mandelbug I myself experienced.
    Instead, it's more a general outline of what these "bugs" are and what limitations they may eventually place on technological advances as a whole.

    ## Sierpinski Triangle What?

    The [Sierpinski Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) is an aesthetically pleasing fractal that can be constructed quite simply even with pen and paper.
    Start with a triangle and then drawn an upside down triangle inside of it.
    Repeat this for each of the triangles that have just been created.
    For more details, I'd encourage you to look elsewhere.
