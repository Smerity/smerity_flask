title: A Light Benchmark of Hetzner's 512MB VPS

    Virtual Private Servers are always a trade-off as you're never getting access to the raw metal.

    ## The Hetzner VPS
    The [Hetzner VPS range](http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produktmatrix_vserver/vserver-produktmatrix) has a few key advantages to consider over other VPS providers such as [Linode](http://www.linode.com/) or [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).

    + Competitive pricing (especially if you're not European and don't need to pay the 19% VAT)
    + Memory, disk and transfer well above the competition
    + Transfer is 100Mbit/s until you hit your bandwidth cap at which point it falls to 10Mbit/s

    For the benchmarks below, I'm testing on the [__vServer VQ 7__](http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_vserver/vq7) which features:

    + 512MB of RAM
    + 20GB hard drive
    + 1TB of transfer (incoming / internal traffic not counted)
    + Single CPU (3074Mhz according to _/proc/cpuinfo_)
    + Price tag of 7,90 Euro (including 19% VAT)

    <p class="alert alert-info">
    The benchmarks below are to give you a general idea of the performance of the VPS.
    Noisy neighbors can have a significant impact on performance and these tests do not run long enough to show their possible impact.

    ## Activation
    Activation all occurred fairly quickly and cleanly, especially when you factor in the difference in time between Sydney, Australia and Nuremberg, Germany (-8 hours).
    Strangely though, they did request a passport scan at the start of the sign-up process.
    If you're a maniacal super-villain you'd best have your fake passport handy.

    + Order request made: (13:16 Sydney &rarr; 5:16 Nuremberg)
    + Request for passport: (17:31 Sydney &rarr; 9:31 Nuremberg)
    + Sent passport scan to Hetzner (18:24 Sydney &rarr; 10:24 Nuremberg)
    + Server access details received (20:33 Sydney &rarr; 12:33 Nuremberg)

    ## Bandwidth Test
    The bandwidth test from _cachefly_ indicates it can essentially max out the 100Mbit/s network card (10.9M/s &rarr; 87 megabits/s).

        :::bash
        smerity@Ubuntu-1110-oneiric-64-minimal:~$ wget http://cachefly.cachefly.net/100mb.test

    ## Redis Benchmark
    When viewing these benchmarks, note that the Hetzner VPS only has a single CPU.
    Whilst Redis only takes advantage of a single core, it needs to share that with the Redis benchmarking program as well, which will likely severly impede the benchmark results.

        :::java
        smerity@Ubuntu-1110-oneiric-64-minimal:~/redis-2.4.10/src$ ./redis-benchmark -q -n 100000

        GET: 57903.88 requests per second

        LPUSH (needed to benchmark LRANGE): 59453.03 requests per second

        LRANGE_500 (first 450 elements): 8402.66 requests per second
        LRANGE_600 (first 600 elements): 6651.59 requests per second
        MSET (10 keys): 37907.50 requests per second

    ## Hard drive speed tests

        :::java
        smerity@Ubuntu-1110-oneiric-64-minimal:~$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=64k count=16k conv=fdatasync
        16384+0 records in
        16384+0 records out
        1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 12.6352 s, 85.0 MB/s

    <hr />

        :::java
        smerity@Ubuntu-1110-oneiric-64-minimal:~/redis-2.4.10/src$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda
        /dev/sda:
         Timing cached reads:   17996 MB in  2.00 seconds = 9007.04 MB/sec
         Timing buffered disk reads: 514 MB in  3.02 seconds = 170.12 MB/sec

    ## Overall
    I'm happy with the VPS as it currently stands.
    The price is low enough to be an "impulse buy" and as long as you can live with a slightly hindered CPU it will do everything you need of it.
    Hetzner is especially tempting if you can use RAM to achieve reasonable performance (Linode's 512MB VPS is around the same price as [Hetzner's 2GB VPS](http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_vserver/vq19)) but it really depends on your machine's workload.
