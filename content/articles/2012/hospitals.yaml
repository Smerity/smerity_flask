    <!--
    + Grandmother went to hospital with a stroke
    + Little they could do, even if it was a city hospital
    + The hospital is full of so many inefficiencies, especially as each group of patients have their own special needs
    + Fruit/juice cups are nearly impossible to open for anyone with impaired mobility
    + Television is pay for
    + There's a lack of a happy atmosphere or consistent time reference -- window to the world
    + Not at all like in House, which isn't a surprise but it's still something you'd like to imagine
    + New found respect for _simple_ devices that require minimal understanding and interaction (Kindle => will the "Slide to unlock" button be too challenging?)
    + Peter -- confused as to what the instruments do

    On the day before Christmas, my grandmother had a stroke.
    She's still in hospital and it appears she has lost the use of her left side.
    Although an entirely unwelcome experience, it has certainly opened my eyes to the case of simplicity and technology.

    ## Extreme Simplicity

    Many tech ventures have become successful through the simplification of previously complicated tasks.

    + Apple iDevices
    + Github
    + Dropbox

    Whilst ease of use is one core concern, there are many other advantages that arise in the pursuit of simplicity.

    1. Less features leads to less choices
    2. Simplification can lead to a redefinition of the problem
    3. It is easier to achieve perfection through simplicity than complexity

    ### Less Features

    Many hackers are aware of the paradox of choice but still give it no heed.
    Hackers, by their nature, want control over every facet of a tool or technology.
    At least, they feel like they want control over every facet.

    At a minimum, too many choices can confuse customers and users alike.
    Just as adding a large block of text in a funnel will decrease your conversion, adding more choices can have the same impact.

    ### Simplification &rarr; Redefinition

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I'd have written you a shorter letter but I didn't have the time.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    Minimalism can often lead to surprising revelations.
    By limiting yourself to the core essentials of your product...
    Treating the symptom and not the disease.

    ### Perfection through Simplicity

    As with any complex system, perfecting the tool's operation or the user experience is a time intensive process.
    There is always one more bug or one more issue to handle.
    This polish takes time and can make the difference between a good and a great product.

    ## Simplicity and E-readers

    Although as charming and intelligent as ever, the stroke has left my grandmother paralysed down her left side.
    Her mobility to begin with was not exceptional.
    Consider all the tasks you do with both hands -- if you're lazy just tie one hand behind your back.
    I guarantee it'll take you less than five minutes to hit a troublesome task.

    One of my grandmother's great loves is reading.
    Reading, though, requires both hands.
    At least with traditional books.
    Try turning the page of a book with one hand.
    Difficult, no?
    Now imagine you're propped into bed whilst doing this.
    Now imagine you have difficulty gripping things.
    All of this lead to a revelation.
    "Technology", I thought. "Technology can fix this!"

    E-readers are becoming advanced enough to be usable every day.
    <!-- They have a battery life that makes it almost -->
    They even have advantages over their carbon based ancestors.
    The text size can be increased and page turning can now be reduced to a single button push.
    Both of these are prime concerns with my grandmother.

    ## The Kindle
