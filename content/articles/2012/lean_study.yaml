    ## The Issue -- Bored of Studies
    Simply put, the Bored of Studies website has barely changed since I was in high school.
    And I'm not exactly young anymore...

    + Ancient tech stack that crashes every year around exam time leaving students without support
    + Insecure tech stack that has previously been hacked into, leaking sensitive information
    + Exploits the students (low quality "premium memberships") whilst also taking money from advertisers
    + No care or thought is put into the website -- the value is derived from the active and helpful forum members
    + Their most recent update was adding an arcade section... Full of games... Games... Games?!?!?

    <p class="alert alert-error">
    Simply put, students deserve a far better resource to help them through such a stressful time
    </p>

    ## The Plan

    + Don't charge the students -- ever
    + Forum that won't go down when needed most (more servers during exam time via Amazon EC2 [Singapore])
    + File Locker for storing exams, study notes, ... (Bored of Studdies rarely update theirs)
    + Facebook integration (with a username/password fallback in case the school has blocked Facebook)
    + Provide moderation power to trusted users (either due to their contributions to the site or as I know them personally)

    <p class="alert alert-info">
    Students shouldn't be charged for "premium membership", especially one that's almost useless (see Bored of Studies)
    </p>

    ## The Revenue

    To keep the website up and going it needs some way to sustain itself.
    Instead of aiming to get the students to pay, have advertisers pay.
    This is already the model in place by Bored of Studies except they try to get money from both ends.

    + Low annoyance advertisements (universities, tutoring colleges, ...)
    + Revenue &rarr; servers, first year university students (mentors / moderators / note creators), my time

    ## My Conclusion

    <p class="alert alert-info">
    Even if all I do is make Bored of Studies retaliate by providing new features (i.e. from this decade) then the students win =]
    </p>
