    On the weekend I caught up with Chris Lloyd, one of the co-founders of [Minefold](https://minefold.com/).
    During our extended cafe / lunch / afternoon chat session, we touched upon a number of things I think it's important to note for posterity.
    __

    ## It always comes back to reality
    When you work on a start-up, it's really about conquering reality.
    You may end up with help (funding, incubator, luck, ...) but the common element is always and will always be the work you put in.

    Reality isn't easy.
    There are no cheats, no simple work-arounds and absolutely no substitutes for good hard work.
    Assuming that there's magic behind the incubators or individuals is a fallacy.
    The awe inspiring companies that you look up to have reached their status thanks to the individuals working at those company.

    ## Fight the Good Fight
    You want to be part of (and hence found) a company that's forging ahead and improving the status quo.
    The time for little ideas is rapidly passing -- there's no real excuse to do little ideas unless you genuinely just want to stay small.
    There's nothing wrong with that but don't kid yourself.
    If you're doing a small project as there's a "reason", ask yourself genuinely if that reason will ever change.
    If that reason won't ever change then you're stalling the inevitable.

    Big ideas and big concepts give you the drive to excel at whatever it is you're planning to do.

    ## Plan for five years ahead
    Look five years ahead at where you want to be and plan for it.
    This is not an uncommon or even surprising concept but it is something that people seem to miss.

    ## Now is the time for risk (_Jumping down the dragon's throat_)
    The old adage of aiming for the stars and landing amongst the clouds holds true.
    Society is pushed forward by those willing to challenge the world as it stands.
    This challenger, this gladiator of the modern age, is what you need to become to make a substantial difference.

    There may be some chance that you'll luck out, but you're in charge of neither -- is that really what you want?
