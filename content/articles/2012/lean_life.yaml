    Over the past few weeks I've been spending more and more time considering the lean startup methodology.
    The methodology is really a codification of the best practices for rapid testing.
    <p class="alert alert-info">
    _More importantly it makes you consider what happens if a test fails_
    </p>

    Maintaining control of failure is an important point when working in the tech industry -- the entire field can change rapidly and failure is part of the norm.
    At Google's scale they must assume that, for a computing task involving hundreds of machines, one of them will die in the midst of the work.
    <p class="alert alert-info">
    _Failure is built into their methodology_  
    </p>
    Recovery after that failure is what's important -- disaster recovery without the disaster.
    _Why can't these general principles be applied to far more than just startups?_

    ## The Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop

    The build-measure-learn feedback loop sits as a core principle of the lean startup methodology.
    To be honest, it's fairly obvious -- but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

    + __Idea__ &rarr; _Build_
    + __Product__ &rarr; _Measure_
    + __Data__ &rarr; _Learn_

    If you replace _Product_ with _Experiment_ then you essentially end up with the scientific method.

    ## Take and apply everywhere

    + _New business idea?_
        + What's the minimum amount of time to get the first iteration off the ground?
        + Is it a fit for the market?
        + Persevere and refine or burn it to the ground and start again?
    + _Want to play a new musical instrument?_
        + What's the cheapest way to get the instrument? Beg, borrow, hire, buy?
        + The minimum song you can learn so you can know if you like it
        + Return the instrument with minimum cost or continue learning

    Repeat ad nauseum.
