    A friend asked me to explain the [Cloudflare Cloudbleed flaw](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139) "in simple English for simple folk".  
    This is my attempt.

    <!--Specifically: "How many steps from someone finding my data in this dump. To matching it to me. and then busting into my email account or Facebook or Amazon?"-->

    ## What is (Charlie) Cloudflare?

    Cloudflare sits as a proxy in front of many websites across the internet.
    When you ask for a web page from many of these websites (including Uber, 1Password, FitBit, and OKCupid), you're actually asking Cloudflare.
    Cloudflare goes to the relevant company, gets the content you request, then gives the reply back to you.

    Think of Cloudflare as **Charlie Cloudflare**, an assistant who prints documents for your entire office.
    Hundreds of people at work use **Charlie** to print documents instead of doing it themselves.
    Most of the time everything works out fine.
    Occasionally however poor **Charlie** gets confused.
    <!--- especially when we ask **Charlie** to modify the document before handing it back to us.-->

    ## What mistake was Charlie making?

    **Charlie** receives two requests at similar times - **Alice** asks **Charlie** to print her bank statement while **Bob** asks **Charlie** to print a short story.

    **Charlie** accidentally prints **Alice**'s bank statement twice but hands her back a correct copy.
    When **Charlie** goes to print **Bob**'s short story, **Charlie** grabs a random page or two from **Alice**'s bank statement by accident and ends up inserting it into **Bob**'s stack of pages.

    Most of the time no-one will notice that anything went wrong, only seeing a brief spurt of gibberish at the end of their document and dismissing it.

    ## Enter Gary Google, the librarian
    
    Meanwhile, there are a few people who use the assistant continuously - specifically **Gary Google**.

    **Gary** prints thousands of pages a day and stores them in a little personal library that anyone can look at and copy from.
    Given **Gary** prints so much, it's likely that **Gary** end up with many random pages, such as a page from **Alice**'s bank statements or the end of **Bob**'s short story.
    
    Eventually **Gary** grabs a document from his library and realizes **Charlie** made a mistake.
    **Gary** looks at a single shelf from his enormous library and finds similar mistakes a number of times.
    
    There's an awful lot of bank statements in this section labelled "Romance" ...

    ## Stop it Charlie!

    **Gary** informs **Charlie** of his error.
    **Charlie** freaks out and tries to fix it.
    **Charlie** stops accidentally inserting pages into other people's documents, tells everyone to discard any documents that have strange pages in them, and then claims the situation is solved.

    Unfortunately, this doesn't fix the issue - **Gary**'s library might have random snippets of anyone's data in there!
    Not only is this true for **Gary**, it's also true for anyone else who grabbed print outs from **Charlie** at the time, including **Alice**, **Bob**, or **Gary**.

    Worst of all, if malicious **Mallory** realized **Charlie**'s mistakes, she might have printed thousands of pages on purpose, searching through the contents she retrieved for these accidental leaks.
    Many of them will likely be innocent enough - maybe a page from **Bob**'s short story - but some many contain the combination to **Alice**'s bank vault.
   
    ## The unfortunate summary ...
 
    We don't know what was leaked, where it was leaked to, or whether the people who received them have stored the copy.
    We only know that any of the documents printed by **Charlie** might have been leaked.

    **Gary Google** is trying to clean his vast library but is still having a real hard time given there are so many files.
    Occasionally it's not even obvious if a random page was slipped into a document - **Bob**'s short stories can get very strange!

    **Bill Bing**, **Duck DuckGo**, **Malicious Mallory**, **Ian InternetArchive**, and **Chloe CommonCrawl** might also still have random pages without having deleted them.
 
    + Is this likely to directly leak your password? Not likely - but we don't know.
    + Is this likely to impact a service you use? Maybe - but again we don't know.
    + Does this impact anyone not using Cloudflare? No.
    + Does this mean any page you've loaded from Cloudflare might have been leaked? Maybe.
    
    There's really not much we can do to know what was leaked unfortunately - or who it was leaked to.
    
    That's potentially the worst part ...
