title: "Remembering The Forgotten: Dithering"

    When most programmers and designers think about dithering, they think of images and animations from an ancient era -
    from the days when games advertised True Colour as a feature and your computer had a turbo button on it.

    Given that, you might think there's no good reason to think about dithering.
    As with anything, though, even anicent skills can still sometimes be useful.
    At the very least, it's pretty fascinating how such a simple tool can work so well.
    Let me add another tool to your arsenal -- even if you don't ever intend to use it.

    ## Brief Reminder: Colours in the Browser (or #FFF)

    In the browser, you'll usually see colours represented in two different ways:

    <ul class="crossed">
      <li>Hexadecimal notation (#RGB or #RRGGBB) where the values can go from 0x00 (0) to 0xFF (255)</li>
      <li>rgb/rgba notation where each of the colour components (and the alpha component for rgba) can be a decimal from 0 to 255</li>
    </ul>

    They're both just ways of telling the browser how much red, green and blue go into making a given colour.
    Each of the colour channels (R, G, B) get 8 bits each -- or 256 different possible values (0 to 255).
    Alpha, or the transparency, can also get 256 different values.

    In total, it takes 24 bits (sum of 8 bits per each of the three colour channels) to convey the colour.
    This means you can view a total of over 16 million colours with the standard 24 bit colour display.
    Sounds pretty reasonable, right?

    ## Limited Colours &amp; Dithering

    Imagine you fell in a trans-space-time-pan-dimensional-worm-hole-thingy which may or may not be run by an unlicensed doctor out of a big blue box.
    Giving you no choice, he's thrown you back in time, back to the days when computers were slow and bits were expensive.
    How can you improve the perceived image quality if you're limited to only displaying a palette 256 different colours on the screen at once?
