title: The Wrong Type of Karma

    Karma's a wonderful way to modify behaviour.
    If the <abbr title="Strangely enough, it reminds me of Bitcoin. If 50% of the computing power in Bitcoin is owned by an aggressor, you can't trust the transactions. If 50% of the karma distribution within a digital community is owned by naive users or trolls, you can't trust karma distribution to enforce the community's guidelines.">majority of the community</abbr> enforce the same set of guidelines, karma can lead to a self stabilising community.

    <blockquote>Good actions are rewarded, bad actions are punished.</blockquote>

    Karma can have a bad side though.
    Like any motivation system, if the distribution of rewards is not correctly aligned with the aims of the program, it can encourage the wrong type of behaviour.

    Before we get started, yes, I am one of those people who thinks about karma too much.
    It's the tool of choice when trying to maintain civility across the Internet.
    Whilst karma might not have a monetary value, it is coveted.
    It's a signal that you're a positive part of a community.
    Strangely enough, that little integer is a humanising factor telling you that you've positively contributed to the community you love and support.

    Traditionally this becomes an issue when users decide to positively recognise behaviour that is considered outside the initial community's guidelines.
    Examples of this would be rewarding funny but low content comments on a website that values high level discussion over humour.
    This again is primarily an issue when there is no majority consensus in a community or they're met with an endless influx of new users with no respect or understanding of the status quo ([Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)).

    Let's assume there's a strong community consensus however and that September is infinitely far away.
    If the community is stable and a user has high karma, that means the user has been a positive contributor to the community.

    What else might they measure themselves on, however?
    I'd wager my money on "any other integer within sight".

    Exhibit A: karma from a <abbr title="Sarcasm due users on the aforesaid website likely chiding me if I link to them in case I invoke the dreaded Eternal September. Of course, my web traffic isn't exactly formidable, so they have little to fear.">completely anonymous</abbr> discussion website.
    What do you notice initially?
    When my account was created, what my total karma is and the average karma each of my posts attract.

    These numbers implicitly give two other interpretations of karma.
    <code>Days / Karma < 1</code> and <code>Karma / Posts = 6.23</code>.
    One indicates your contribution per day to the community whilst the other indicates how recognised each contribution is.

    I'd argue that average karma per post inspires the wrong behaviour on the website.
    Why?
    Karma per post relies on more than just the quality of your post.
    The amount of karma you receive per post is more tightly aligned with the number of people who view it than the quality.

    This discourages you from responding to or involving yourself in unpopular discussions.

    Why does this bother me so much?
    Computer game companies make billions per year by convincing users that larger integers means more satisfaction.
    Similarly, my brain is hard wired to attempt to increase both the total karma and average karma.
    This means to [win the game](https://news.ycombinator.com/leaders) I need to avoid playing it whenever the post could gain less than 6.23 karma.

    Well, starting today I'm turning cold that hot wiring.
    Comment quickly, comment often.
    Obviously not to spam content, but simply if I have something positive to contribute, I should contribute it.
    Average karma be damned.
    If it helps one person or ignites a small but intellectual discussion, then that's reward enough.
    Let my average karma go to rot.
    They're just bits and they'd wrap around when I hit <code>4294967296</code> anyway.
