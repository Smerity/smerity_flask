title: Where did all the HTTP referrers go?
date: 2013-05-26
content: |
    Good (and bad news): the general consensus in the web developer community is that any and every website should be HTTPS by default.
    Why?
    HTTP by itself isn't encrypted, leaving it open to eavesdropping, message tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    HTTPS, if you use it <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/" title="Help avoid this by learning about HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)">consistently</a>, prevents these issues.

    So how can that possibly be bad news?
    The Internet is built on data and <abbr title="PageRank uses metadata, how websites link to each other, to rank importance of pages, amongst many other metadata uses.">metadata</abbr>.
    HTTPS is killing one of the core metadata tools of the Internet: HTTP Referrers.

    ## define(HTTP Referrers)

    Imagine you're on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/search?q=homakov) and click on a link to [homakov.blogspot.ru](http://homakov.blogspot.ru/2013/05/csrf-tool.html).
    The server at __homakov.blogspot.ru__ knows that you came from __reddit.com__.
    It even knows what specific webpage you came from -- in this case, a Reddit search page on /r/netsec searching for _homakov_.

    So what does this look like?
    When your browser wants a page, it sends a GET request with a number of HTTP headers.
    One of these headers is the HTTP Referrer and informs server B that you came from a link at server A.

        :::bash
        GET http://homakov.blogspot.ru/2013/05/csrf-tool.html HTTP/1.1
        Referer: http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/search?q=homakov
        Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.31 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/26.0.1410.63 Safari/537.31
        Connection: keep-alive
        Cookie: session="x1yc3OWM2ZTdhNNzk1YWY5NDk0MTczNTEKc=="; csrftoken="6QjAl18WY3NyZgpNsHpEKotZNfEtzSLocHRm";
        Host: homakov.blogspot.ru
        Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
        Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
        Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch

    The second line, `Referer: http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/search?q=homakov`, is the HTTP Referrer.
    It's these HTTP Referrer fields that are tracked by analytics tools such as Google Analytics and ChartBeat.

    ## HTTPS kills HTTP Referrers

    HTTPS turns off HTTP Referrers.
    Why?
    According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1)</a>, this is due to the possibility of sensitive information being encoded in a referring URL:

    <blockquote>
      Clients <i>SHOULD NOT</i> include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol.
    </blockquote>

    This is quite reasonable considering HTTPS was intended for secure applications where sensitive data may be stored or gleaned from the URL.
    Unfortunately, this hard set rule doesn't transition well into a future where almost every website uses HTTPS.

    ## Fixing Referrers in HTTPS: The Meta Referrer

    So what's the situation with our HTTP Referrer?
    What do we want to be possible?
    We'll label these different situations with names.

    + __Never:__ Our URLs are sensitive and we don't want to tell the world about them. We want the HTTP Referrer dropped (i.e. default behaviour for HTTPS).
    + __Origin:__ I run a search engine and want people to know the traffic came from me, but not which search queries were used to reach your site.
    + __Default:__ I run Facebook and want to pass the HTTP referrer for all requests unless it goes from HTTPS to HTTP (i.e. the situation where previously hidden information might be disclosed).
    + __Always:__ A blog hosted over HTTPS might wish to link to a blog hosted over HTTP and receive trackback links.

    These cases are covered under a new HTML5 called the [meta referrer](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Meta_referrer).
    Now a sinple tag can be used, such as `<meta name="referrer" content="always">`, to specify the exact behaviour of the HTTP Referrer regardless of whether we're using HTTP or HTTPS.

    With that said, not all web browsers support this new fangled HTML5 meta referrer.
    If a web browser doesn't support this flag, it'll just fall back to the standard for HTTP or HTTPS.
    Which browsers support these?

    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <th>Web Browser</th>
        <th>Meta Referrer Support</th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Google Chrome
          <td><span class="text-success">Yes</span>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Safari
          <td><span class="text-success">Yes</span>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Firefox
          <td><span class="text-error">No</span> (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704320">In Progress</a>)
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Internet Explorer
          <td><span class="text-error">No</span>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    Well, okay, that's fine, the world improves.
    Let's say in a year they'll get it <abbr title="I _might_ be a little optimistic here...">all sorted</abbr>.
    Then we need all the popular websites to add these meta referrer tags in their HTML.
    And all the not so popular websites that still give you traffic.

    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <th>Website</th>
        <th>Meta Referrer</th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>https://www.facebook.com</td>
          <td>Yes: Default</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>https://www.google.com</td>
          <td>Yes: Origin</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><s>Reddit</s>
          <td>Yes: HTTP and no meta referrer
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hacker News
          <td>No: <abbr title="&lt;sarcasm&gt;Likely a defense against the dreaded Eternal September&lt;/sarcasm&gt;">HTTPS with no meta referrer</abbr>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    ## Add the metatag, save the world

    So, here's my little request.

    <blockquote>
      If you run a website over HTTPS and there are positive benefits from others seeing your HTTPS Referrers, add in an appropriate meta referrer.
    </blockquote>

    #### Tangent: Referrer vs Referer

    The correct spelling is refe<b>rr</b>er (two arrs) but you'll see it everywhere as refe<b>r</b>er (minimal arrs).
    Why?
    A small accident of history.
    Every reference to refe<b>rr</b>er is spelt refe<b>r</b>er in [RFC 1945 (HTTP 1.0)](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg-old/1995JanApr/0105.html).
    By the time it was [picked up](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg-old/1995JanApr/0105.html), it was a little too late.
