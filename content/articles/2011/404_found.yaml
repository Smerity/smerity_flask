    When rewriting the core blog engine of my site, I came to a strange Zen like programming realisation...


    Traditionally, if a user is lost, they receive a 404 Not Found page.
    If, however, they are looking for the 404 Not Found page, then they found the page they were looking for.


    Hence, 404 should return the HTTP status code __404 Not Found__ unless they're looking for the _404_ page, in which case the HTTP status code should be __200 OK__.

    ## Are you mad?

    To be fair, it would not be the first time I've lost my mind, but at least one site backs me up in this!
    The [404 page](http://www.github.com/404) over at [GitHub](http://www.github.com) returns 200 OK when visited directly.

        :::java
        smerity@hermes:~$ curl -I https://github.com/404
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Server: nginx/1.0.4
        Date: Mon, 28 Nov 2011 16:07:31 GMT
        Content-Type: text/html
        Content-Length: 17461
        Last-Modified: Mon, 28 Nov 2011 04:30:43 GMT
        Connection: keep-alive
        Accept-Ranges: bytes

    If this is repeated for another page that is legitimately _Not Found_ then the server returns __404 Not Found__.


    This website also obeys the 404 Zen rule, though only due to the static nature of the site.
    This website resides on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and as such is entirely static.
    To have a 404 page, you must provide _404.html_.
    As _404.html_ is a genuine file, it makes sense to return __200 OK__ when it is directly requested.

    ## Less Mad, Even Logic

    If you believe the adage "Always be marketing", these error pages represent opportunity.
    Google and other search engines won't traditionally index 404s or other errors though.
    By returning __404 Not Found__ you're telling it, point blank, that the page contains no value and was caused by an error either by the server or the client.

    GitHub's error pages both have aesthetic value (a [Star Wars themed octocat](https://github.com/404) and a [Wile E. Coyote style octocat](https://github.com/500)) and have received interest from [the tech community](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2056629).
    As they return __200 OK__, the links from the community positively impact their Google PageRank.

    Another example of the "Always be marketing" angle is Blippy's 404 page, which was covered on [Tech Crunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/03/blippy-404/) and numerous other sites.
    They've made a major mistake if they're following that adage, however.
    As Blippy's [404 page](http://blippy.com/404) returns __404 Not Found__, it is not indexed by Google and contributes nothing to the site's PageRank.
